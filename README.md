# Rock-Paper-Scissors Project

Welcome to this Rock-Paper-Scissors project, from _**The Odin Project**_! This project will be in two parts: the first one will let the user play, but with no interface, only from the browser console, and the second one will feature a proper interface. 

# Rules

The user plays against the computer in a **FT5** (First To Five): you need to win **five** rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors to win it all! If you have never played the game, or just as a quick refresher, here are the possibilities to win one round:
- **Rock** beats **Scissors**
- **Scissors** beat **Paper**
- **Paper** beats **Rock**.

The moves from the computer are generated randomly.

Good Luck!
